HearHere utilizes geometric features of sound to
categorize a tapping sound within a grid. The geometric features
are based on the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of the sound
between two microphones. By using this classification, any off the
shelf phone with stereo recording capability can be made into a music
producing device. The first step is to calibrate your surface. Imagine a set of six piano keys
    laid out in front of your device, labeled A-F. HearHere transforms these positions into MIDI controllers!
    After calibrating the six positions, play the HearHere game by tapping a location and hearing the corresponding sound! </string>
